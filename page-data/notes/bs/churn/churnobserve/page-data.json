Customers before Churning</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sometimes, it's helpful to observe a customer after they've churned</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In this case, it's easier to acquire customers who've already purchased or engaged</li>\n<li>But, it's easier to retain customers who are already purchasing or engaging</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>However, it's most helpful to observe a customer <em>before</em> they've churned</li>\n<li>To do this, we can use behavioral features to measure their propensity to churn</li>\n<li>\n<p>This may include any of the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logins</li>\n<li>Clicks</li>\n<li>Email opens</li>\n<li>Likes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specifically, we can look at behavioral features of customers who've already churned</p>\n<ul>\n<li>And, we can determine common trends amongst particular segments of customers who've churned</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This involves observing behavioral features in a window of time before customers churn</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This window of time should be shorter for customers who purchase or engage frequently</li>\n<li>However, this window of time should be longer for customers who purchase or engage infrequently</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Observing Renewals with Churns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>While gathering our customers for clustering, we'll want to include a mix of churned and retained customers</li>\n<li>By doing this, we can compare churned customers with retained customers to determine any difference</li>\n<li>Typically, we'll pick enough retentions so that the number of retained observations are in proportion to the true retention rate</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Identifying Active Periods for Non-Subscriptions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculating active periods that accurately reflect periods when a customer interacted with a product is an important part of determining churn for nonsubscription services</li>\n<li>In this case, churn refers to a customer becoming inactive for more than some maximum allowed time</li>\n<li>Note, this time period is adjustable, but likely is around a month or a few months</li>\n<li>\n<p>This window of time should be decided for segments of customers, such that once they go inactive they donâ€™t come back</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Or, it would be fair to consider it a fresh start if they do come back</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Choosing Observation Dates for Churn Indicators</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Choosing observation windows is important when investigating leading indicators of churn</li>\n<li>\n<p>Churn leading indicators are behaviors that customers likely engage in before they've churned</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These behaviors are usually the underlying cause of churn</li>\n<li>Usually, lead times before churn may be a few weeks in advance of churn for a consumer product and one to three months for a business product</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Churn lagging indicators are behaviors that customers likely engage in after they've churned</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These behaviors are usually the underlying cause of churn</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When determining a churn indicator, both churns and non-churns should be included in the sample</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Roughly, reflecting the true proportion of actual churn and renewal rate</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When creating a churn indicator, we typically first identify active periods for each customer</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which, is when a customer has at least one event within a short time</li>\n<li>Events are aggregated into weeks as a single indicator of whether a customer had any events in that particular week</li>\n<li>Then, active periods are found from those active weeks</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fightchurnwithdata.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Textbook for Fighting Churn with Data</a></li>\n<li><a
