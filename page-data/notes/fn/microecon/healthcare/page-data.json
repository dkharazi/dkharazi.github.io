about third party intervention:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Third Parties</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insurers, governments, and unwitting bystanders are typically involved</li>\n<li>Meaning, they have an interest in healthcare outcomes</li>\n<li>Generally, market failures can be created when third parties enter a buyer/seller market</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seller receives payment from third party, instead of buyer</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Healthcare providers are often paid not by the patients but by private or government health insurance</li>\n<li>Generally, including a third party in the relationship of the buyer and select can create market failures</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allocation of resources are determined by rules established by third party</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rules established by insurers determine the allocation of resources</li>\n<li>Allocation of resources should be determined by market prices in a perfectly competitive market</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Complaints about lack of third party (less government intervention):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Prevalence of Externalities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Externalities in the healthcare market are extremely prevalent </li>\n<li>Because externalities are so prevalent, they may need government action to remedy market failure</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few examples of externalities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Getting vaccinated is a positive externality</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting vaccinated has some cost: money or receiving side effects</li>\n<li>Thus, too few people would decide to get vaccinated on their own</li>\n<li>As a result, there wouldn’t be a huge need to develop vaccines, since it wouldn’t so profitable</li>\n<li>Unless, the government requires vaccination</li>\n<li>This subsidizes development, manufacture, and distribution of vaccines</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The benefit of medical research is a positive externality to other physicians</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Without government intervention, there would be too little research</li>\n<li>Governments can incentivize research through funding and by granting patents</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Everyone involved doesn’t have perfect information</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buyers rely on the advice of sellers for what the buyer needs (e.g. types of treatment)</li>\n<li>Generally, knowledge needs to shared evenly between buyers and sellers to avoid market failures</li>\n<li>\n<p>This causes the need for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitoring of the quality of a product</li>\n<li>Buying leads to various regulations</li>\n<li>Licensing requirements</li>\n<li>Too difficult to open new medical schools</li>\n<li>FDA regulations</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The above regulations limit the supply of healthcare goods and services</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Arguably: Healthcare is a public good</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market failure occurs with public goods</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Complaints with the Insurance Market:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Problem of Moral Hazard</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moral hazard refers to the tendency of a person to engage in undesirable behavior because he/she is imperfectly monitored</li>\n<li>If patients don’t pay for doctor visits, then they may go often for minor symptoms (e.g. cold, flu, etc.)</li>\n<li>This leads to increased unnecessary costs and longer wait times</li>\n<li>To avoid this, insurance companies charge patients co-pays (e.g. $20)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adverse Selection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some customers have preexisting conditions or chronic diseases, which aren’t observable by insurers</li>\n<li>As a result, people with greater hidden health problems are more likely to buy health insurance than healthy people</li>\n<li>In order for insurance companies to cover its costs, the price of health insurance must reflect the cost of a sicker-than-average person (since healthier people opted out)</li>\n<li>As people drop coverage, the insurance market fails to achieve its purpose of eliminating the financial risk from illness</li>\n<li>This is a phenomenon called the death spiral</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act and Adverse Selection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Affordable Care Act attempted to reduce the problem of adverse selection</li>\n<li>It required Americans to either buy health insurance or pay a tax (acting as a penalty)</li>\n<li>Specifically, it prevented insurers from charging more to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions</li>\n<li>The goal of the mandate was to increase the number of healthy people buying insurance</li>\n<li>Thereby, reducing the problem of adverse selection and lowering the cost of insurance</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p><a
