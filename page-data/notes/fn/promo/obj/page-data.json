Environment for Promotions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As an overview, the environment for promotions can contain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consumers:</strong> People consuming a good (e.g. end

channels</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promotions are communicated to consumers via marketing channels</li>\n<li>Promotions can also be communicated via marketing channels of wholesalers and manufacturers

loyalty to the retailer</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Introducing Customer Targeting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The goal of promotions is to provide incentives to consumers</li>\n<li>By doing this, promotions will improve sales and build better relationships</li>\n<li>\n<p>As a reminder, promotions have the following major problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer targeting</li>\n<li>Product discovery</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For now, we'll just focus on customer targeting</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer targeting must answer these problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who are the right recipients for a promotion?</li>\n<li>What are the right promotional properties?</li>\n<li>What is the optimal time to offer it?</li>\n<li>What is the right delivery channel?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The best method for customer targeting is <em>targeted campaigns</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Motivating the Use of Targeted Campaigns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The best method for customer targeting is <em>targeted campaigns</em></li>\n<li>\n<p>A targeted campaign involves the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plan something</li>\n<li>Execute that something</li>\n<li>Measure that something</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defining Business Objectives for Promotions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Business objectives of promotions should focus on maximizing ROI</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each campaign should have a positive ROI</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ROI is defined as the difference between <em>gains</em> and <em>costs</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ROI should be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Predicted before campaign execution</li>\n<li>Measured after the campaign is fully or partially executed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defining the Gains and Costs of Promotions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The costs of a campaign include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Distribution costs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coupon design and printing costs</li>\n<li>Marketing agency fees</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Coupon-redemption costs</li>\n<li>Clearing-house costs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The gains of a campaign include sales</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to Maximize the ROI of Campaigns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Targeted campaigns have the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Testing something</li>\n<li>Measuring something</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As a result, targeted campaigns act as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A lesson teaching us if something is effective</li>\n<li>A tool for acquiring, maximizing, and retaining customers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In order to maximize ROI of campaigns, we must focus on each of the three phases of the customer lifecycle</li>\n<li>\n<p>Meaning, each campaign should analyze each phase of the customer lifecycle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer acquisition</li>\n<li>Customer maximization</li>\n<li>Customer retention</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defining the Goals of Customer Lifecycle</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer acquisition focuses on the customers never interacted with the brand</li>\n<li>Customer maximization focuses on the customers who interact with the brand</li>\n<li>Customer churn focuses on the customers who stop interacting with the brand</li>\n<li>The goal of customer acquisition is to <em>increase new customers</em></li>\n<li>The goal of customer maximization is to <em>increase the number of products purchased by existing customers</em></li>\n<li>The goal of customer retention is to <em>increase the number of potentially lost customers</em></li>\n<li>Increasing each of these three phases will maximize the ROI of a campaign</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Illustrating the Customer Lifecycle Model</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The goal of a customer lifecycle model is to model the sales customer's gain at each phase of the customer lifecycle</li>\n<li>\n<p>To do to this, the lifecycle model contains two components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Predicting customer propensity</li>\n<li>Predicting customer sales gain</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Here, customer propensity refers to the customer's chance of gaining</li>\n<li>Here, customer sales gain refers to the sales generated by the customer</li>\n<li>\n<p>In other words, we must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, predict a customer's sales gain</li>\n<li>Then, predict the customer's propensity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We should target high-propensity customers with large sales gains</li>\n<li>Meaning, we'd like to find the customers we're certain will generate the highest expected sales</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/9655fca0ce6e9ab7bbe38d0868cdbc69/customerlifecycle.svg\" alt=\"customerlifecycle\"></p>\n<h3>Defining a Framework for Customer Lifecycle</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A campaign model must predict the customer's sales gain by comparing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The expected sales gain without a campaign</li>\n<li>The expected sales gain with a campaign</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These must predict customer propensity and customer sales gain</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
